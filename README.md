# FRC Team 2637 Repository: T2637-2023-UNTIL-HOUSTON

Welcome to the official repository of FRC Team 2637: the Panthers, for the 2023 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) game, Charged Up! Here, you will find all of our work leading up to the Houston Championship. This repository serves as the hub for our software development, collaboration, and a testament to the hard work of our dedicated team members.

## About Charged Up
In Charged Up, robots compete to harness the power of the atom by collecting and storing 'particles' into 'power cells'. Detailed information about the game rules can be found in the official [FRC Game Manual](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system). 

## Repository Structure
Here's a general overview of our project layout:

- **`/src`**: The source files for our robot code.
- **`/doc`**: Documentation and design specifications for this year's robot.
- **`/test`**: Unit tests to validate the functionality of our codebase.
- **`/resources`**: Miscellaneous resources like game strategies and research documents.

We follow a branch-and-pull request model for changes. Please see our [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed steps to contribute to our codebase.

## Disclaimer
While it might sound odd, there have been a spate of incidents where folks have mistaken our sophisticated and polished Readme for the work of an AI. We'd like to clarify with a touch of humor:

> As an AI language model... Oops! Wrong script. This Readme is proudly and *humanly* crafted by FRC Team 2637. Any resemblance to a sophisticated AI is purely coincidental, and quite flattering. Our coders have, in fact, passed the Turing test!

## Fun Fact
Did you know? The "Panthera Purrgrammers" on our team have a knack for naming our debugging sessions. One of our favorites is "debugging the undebaggable." Catchy, right? Keep an eye out for more entertaining nuggets like this as you explore our repository.

## Contact Us
For any queries or feedback, you can contact us at [team2637@school.edu](mailto:team2637@school.edu).

Thanks for visiting our repository. Let's get charged up and power through to Houston!
